This repository contains data and R code for robust local likelihood estimation for nonstationary flood frequency analysis. The data and code presented here are used in the (submitted 2023) paper by John Grego and Philip Yates.

To perform the robust local likelihood estimation:

  - Read the file `peak.txt` into R. This file contains the annual maximum discharge for the Congaree River at Columbia, SC (USGS Gage 02169500) for the flood years 1892 to 2022. The data can also be found on the [USGS Water website](https://nwis.waterdata.usgs.gov/sc/nwis/peak?site_no=02169500&agency_cd=USGS&format=html).
